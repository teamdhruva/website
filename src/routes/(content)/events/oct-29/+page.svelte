    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-yellow-300 mb-4">About the Lecture</h2>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, born on October 19th, 1910, was one of the most influential astrophysicists of the 20th century. 
      His career spanned multiple distinct phases, each marked by significant contributions, culminating in a published book. The first phase of his work, where he derived the limiting mass for white dwarfs, led to a Nobel Prize after a 50-year delay.
      This lecture will review the key moments of Chandrasekhar‚Äôs life, exploring his contributions across six distinct phases.
