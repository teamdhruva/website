      <p>
        We built a 6 inch Newtonian telescope from scratch, with a focal length
        of 1200 mm and a maximum magnification of 300x. The telescope was built
        using PVC pipes and a 6 inch mirror. It's not just the moon, but also
        prominent planets like Jupiter and Saturn that are a sight to behold!
      </p>

      <p>
        This telescope - sans the readymade mirror - was made from scratch. We
        built and assembled it using 3D printed parts and PVC pipes.

      <p>
        Regular sky observation sessions are conducted using the telescope. We
        also use the telescope for astrophotography.
      </p>

      <p>
        The future plan of this project is to mount it upon a fully automated
        equatorial mount - which is also being developed by the team. This will
        allow the telescope to reach its full potential and be controlled
        remotely to point at any celestial object.
